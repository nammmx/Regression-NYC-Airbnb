In this notebook I will be exploring the NYC Airbnb data set in order to find a good prediction model for the outcome variable "price". After some data cleaning and exploratory data analysis I will evaluate the model performances of 3 different models (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression) with different input variables (phase 1-4) and check the model assumptions of linear regression.

* Phase 1: With outliers, no polynomial terms
* Phase 2: With outliers, with polynomial terms
* Phase 3: No outliers, no polynomial terms
* Phase 4: No outliers, no polynomial terms



The specific steps are the following:

**1. Data Cleaning**

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
  * Categorical variables
  * Numerical variables
  * Outcome variable
  
**3. Model Building (Phase 1-4)**
  * Data splitting
  * Preprocessing
  * Model building
  
**4. Model Comparison (Phase 1-4)**
  * Predictions
  * Model comparison
  
**5. Check Model Assumptions for Linear Regression**
  * Linearity
  * Normality
  * Homoscedasticity
  * Multicollinearity
